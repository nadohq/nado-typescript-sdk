# `@nadohq/mobile-client`

HTTP client for the Nado mobile service API. Manages usernames, bios, avatars, public profile lookups,
global and session-based trade feeds, the follower/following graph, privacy settings, and push notification
devices/preferences. Public queries require no wallet; authenticated operations use EIP-712 + msgpack signing.

## Usage

```ts
import { MobileClient, MOBILE_CLIENT_ENDPOINTS } from '@nadohq/mobile-client';
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { ink } from 'viem/chains';

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account: privateKeyToAccount('0x...'),
  chain: ink,
  transport: http(),
});

const mobile = new MobileClient({
  url: MOBILE_CLIENT_ENDPOINTS.inkMainnet,
  walletClient,
});

// Unsigned public lookups
const availability = await mobile.getUsernameAvailability({ displayName: 'Alice.One' });
const [profile] = await mobile.getProfiles({
  subaccounts: [{ subaccountOwner: '0x...', subaccountName: 'default' }],
  include: { followCounts: true },
});

// Signed operations
await mobile.setUsername({
  subaccountOwner: walletClient.account.address,
  subaccountName: 'default',
  chainId: ink.id,
  verifyingAddr: '0x...',
  displayName: 'Alice.One',
});
```

## API Surface

### Public Queries

`getAvatarPresets`, `getUsernameAvailability`, `getProfiles`, `searchProfiles`, `getFollowers`, `getFollowing`, `getFeed`,
`getNotificationPreferences`, `getRegisteredWallet`, `getForYouFeed`, `getTopTradersFeed`,
`getFriendsFeed`, `getProfileFeed`, `getMarketFeed`, `getPositionFeed`, `getFeedItem`, `getFeedUpdates`.

`getProfiles` is the only profile route: it batches up to 25 subaccounts, returns them in the requested order,
and carries follower totals (`include.followCounts`) and a follow summary (`include.followSummary.viewAs`) as
opt-in includes, so use it for a single subaccount too. The backend still serves the older singular `profile`
request for compatibility, but it returns base fields only and costs more weight than the batched equivalent,
so the SDK does not expose it.

`searchProfiles` finds claimed profiles by username prefix, paged in ascending username order with an exact match
first. It takes the same `include` as `getProfiles`, which caps the page at 25 instead of 50 and weighs far more
against the shared IP rate limit, so search without it while the user types and enrich once the prefix settles.
A cursor is bound to the query alone, so an enriched page can continue an unenriched search.

`getFollowers` and `getFollowing` take an optional `viewAs`, which selects a viewer perspective rather than
proving one: with it the page is ordered familiar-first and every row carries an `isFollowing`, without it the
page is ordered by the listed relationship alone and `isFollowing` is absent rather than `false`. As with
`include.followSummary.viewAs`, an unsigned route means the claimed viewer is not verified.

`getFeed` returns the global trade feed. Session-based feeds include `getForYouFeed`, `getTopTradersFeed`,
and `getFriendsFeed` (requires `viewAs`), plus `getProfileFeed`, `getMarketFeed`, and `getPositionFeed`.
`getFeedItem` reads one item; `getFeedUpdates` polls session patches using the returned `viewerToken`.
All are unsigned. Profile, position, and item reads include the `viewAs` account's own hidden content under
`account_view`; the viewing account is not proof of wallet ownership. Prices are decimal `BigNumber` values;
quantities, notionals, and PnL retain x18 units. See method and parameter JSDoc for session and polling rules.

### Public Executes

`unregisterExpoToken`, `updateNotificationPreferences`. These are authenticated by possession of an active Expo
push token rather than a wallet signature, so they still work at logout when a signature may be unobtainable.

### Signed Executes

`setUsername`, `setBio`, `createAvatarUpload`, `setAvatar`, `setPrivateMode`, `registerExpoToken`, `setFollow`.

### Linked Signers

The mobile client supports linked signers for delegated transaction signing:

```ts
mobile.setLinkedSigner(linkedSignerWalletClient);
```
